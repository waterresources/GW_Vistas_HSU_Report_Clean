# Groundwater Vistas Delete Excess Rows from HSU Report

## App Description
This top down scrip simply deletes out unwanted rows that are in the first row (row[0]) of the
exported HSU report from a retirement or transfer analysis. It is built off of J. Reedy script in VBA but is
much faster

## Instructions
Make sure the exported HSU Report from GW Vistas is opened in Excel and saved as this eliminates the
file error. 

Make sure to update this file path to the location of the exported HSU (currently in the external 1tb ssd drive)

New file should be ready to be copied and pasted into the anaysis workbook to compare results from the baseline analysis
